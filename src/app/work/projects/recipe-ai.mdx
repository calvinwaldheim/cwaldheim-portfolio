## AI-Powered Recipe App (iOS Prototype)

I designed and built a fully functional iOS prototype of an **AI-enabled recipe app** that generates recipes through natural conversation. Unlike static recipe websites, the app integrates **pantry tracking** and **dietary preferences**, delivering **AI-generated recipes** that are both personalized and practical.  

### The User Problem  
Static recipe websites are cluttered with ads, slow to navigate, and optimized for clicks rather than real cooking. They encourage "recipe-first" cooking, which often:  
- Requires buying extra ingredients just to follow instructions.  
- Increases costs and food waste.  
- Limits creativity, since users focus on replication instead of exploration.  

From my own experience, I discovered that **AI-generated recipes** could unlock a new way of cooking—one guided by what you already have and how you like to eat.  

### Solution  
The app rethinks how people interact with cooking: instead of searching for fixed recipes, users describe their pantry items and preferences, and the AI generates creative, adaptable meal ideas.  

Key features:  
- **AI-generated recipes via conversation**: Users chat with the app to co-create meals.  
- **Pantry integration**: Reduces waste by suggesting meals with available ingredients.  
- **Dietary personalization**: Adjusts recipes to individual health goals and restrictions.  
- **Firebase integration**: Authentication and Firestore for user data storage.  
- **Interactive cooking experience**: Step-by-step instructions throughout the recipe preparation.

The design philosophy encourages confidence in the kitchen, helps **save money**, and makes cooking more fun.

### Learning Highlights  
- Built an iOS app in **SwiftUI**, integrating **Firebase Auth** and Firestore.  
- Designed and tested **AI prompts** to consistently generate useful recipes.  
- Created an **end-to-end prototype**, proving both technical feasibility and user value.  

### Outcome  
The prototype shows how **AI-generated recipes** can transform cooking into a more personal, sustainable, and creative experience. It reflects my ability to merge **creativity, technology, and entrepreneurship** into products that address real user pain points.
