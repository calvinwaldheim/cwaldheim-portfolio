## From IT to Product: Driving Product Platform Adoption – ERIKS Digital

When I joined ERIKS Digital, the organization was still operating with a traditional IT mindset: projects, tickets, and delivery focus. Over time, I helped lead the transformation towards a **product platform approach**, organizing around Product, Platform, and Data teams.  

### Jira Align: Scaling Product & Portfolio Management  
As part of this shift, I supported the rollout of **Jira Align** across ERIKS Digital. This created transparency across teams, enabled portfolio-level prioritization, and connected strategy to execution. My role included training stakeholders, refining ways of working, and ensuring alignment across business and technology.  

### Jira Product Discovery: Introducing Modern Product Practices  
After Jira Align reached maturity, I spearheaded the adoption of **Atlassian’s new Jira Product Discovery** tool. For many teams, the concept of structured product discovery was new. I:  
- Educated and coached Product Managers on discovery best practices.  
- Configured Jira PD for all product teams to track opportunities, assumptions, and validation.  
- Managed discovery and portfolio reporting for the **CDIO and ERIKS Management Board**, ensuring leadership had clear visibility into innovation initiatives.  

### Innovation Culture: Hackathons & Beyond  
Beyond tooling, I supported ERIKS’ cultural shift towards innovation. Twice, I helped organize the **annual ERIKS Digital hackathon** in collaboration with Cognizant at their Amsterdam offices. My role was to:  
- Frame challenges relevant to ERIKS’ strategy.  
- Mentor teams in finding solutions and preparing compelling board-level pitches.  
- Facilitate a space where experimentation and creativity could thrive.  

### Outcome  
This transformation helped ERIKS evolve from a project-oriented IT function into a **product-driven digital organization**. By embedding modern product discovery practices, scaling portfolio reporting, and fostering innovation culture, ERIKS Digital built stronger alignment between strategy and execution—while empowering teams to think beyond delivery and towards customer outcomes.
