## Gaia Growth: Vertical Farming Automation

In 2019, vertical farming was at its hype peak. Together with two friends, I co-founded **Gaia Growth**, aiming to create automation software for vertical farming startups that lacked the resources to build proprietary control systems. Our vision was to help farms monitor and control their grow operations with IoT-based tools.  

To validate our idea, we entered the **YES!Delft startup accelerator** and conducted one of the most comprehensive customer discovery efforts in the European vertical farming scene. Over two years, we spoke to nearly **200 startups and operators**, building a CRM of insights on challenges, systems, and needs across the industry.  

### What we did
- Explored automation solutions using **AWS, MQTT, and Shelly hardware** to enable remote monitoring and control.  
- Investigated different cultivation systems—from open land to greenhouses to vertical farms—to understand operational bottlenecks.  
- Applied **lean startup principles** rigorously, testing assumptions through direct customer interviews and prototypes.  

### What we learned
Through validation, we uncovered that the **core issues** holding back vertical farming weren’t software but **hardware costs and energy consumption**. Software could optimize operations, but it was only a small lever compared to the overwhelming challenges of infrastructure and energy economics.  

As many of our contacts exited the market, we decided to stop Gaia Growth before investing further. In hindsight, our analysis proved correct: the global narrative soon shifted as vertical farming was revealed to be less viable than promised.  

### Outcome
While Gaia Growth did not continue, the experience gave me deep exposure to **agriculture, IoT technology, and startup validation frameworks**. It sharpened my ability to distinguish between hype and structural business reality, and taught me how to run disciplined customer discovery at scale.  

The lessons from Gaia Growth continue to inform my product management approach—particularly the importance of testing assumptions early and focusing on solvable, high-leverage problems.
