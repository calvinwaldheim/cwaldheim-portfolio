## WIKI: Graph-Based Product 360 Catalog – ERIKS Digital

Before WIKI, ERIKS’ product data landscape was fragmented. Each country ran its own e-commerce catalog, ERP article data was difficult to search, and additional product information sat in spreadsheets or local systems. Finding reliable data across 1.5M SKUs was slow, inconsistent, and frustrating for sales teams, product managers, and engineers alike.  

WIKI was created as an **innovation spin-off** to tackle this problem: a single internal catalog that unified all ERIKS product data into one searchable, contextual platform. At its core, WIKI combined:  
- **Neo4j** to model relationships between products and specifications.  
- **Elasticsearch** to deliver high-performance, multilingual search at scale.  

Together, these technologies allowed ERIKS to not only consolidate data but also enrich it with business logic, surfacing smarter recommendations and product connections.  

### My role
When the initial Product Manager left, I took ownership of WIKI and steered it from prototype to global rollout:  
- **Global adoption:** Expanded WIKI to all ERIKS countries and languages, ensuring consistency across regions.  
- **Cross-sell graph logic:** Implemented nodes that encoded product specialists’ knowledge—e.g., surfacing alternatives, replacements, or compatible products like seals and couplings.  
- **User growth:** Scaled usage to 900–1,000 active internal users across sales, account management, product management, and engineering.  
- **Strategic alignment:** Ensured the tool wasn’t just a catalog, but a productivity driver—shortening time to information, improving quote accuracy, and embedding expert knowledge into the system.  

### Outcome
WIKI became the **single source of truth** for ERIKS’ product data, giving teams instant access to the entire catalog of 1.5M SKUs in one place. By capturing cross-selling and compatibility logic inside the graph, it also turned tribal knowledge into a scalable, reusable asset.  

Perhaps most importantly, WIKI served as a **learning ground for ERIKS’ digital commerce strategy**: the architecture and best practices developed here informed how ERIKS later built scalable product search into its e-commerce platforms.  

WIKI proved that complex product ecosystems can be transformed into usable, business-driving tools—bridging the gap between data, technology, and commercial value.
