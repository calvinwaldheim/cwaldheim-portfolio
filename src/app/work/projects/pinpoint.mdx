## PinPoint: AI-Integrated Whiteboard Experiment

PinPoint is a **web-native whiteboard app** I built to explore how AI and whiteboarding can work together more seamlessly. Alongside the webapp, I developed a **Chrome extension** that allows users to pin ChatGPT messages directly into their PinPoint canvas—preserving formatting and enabling further editing.  

### The User Problem  
AI assistants like ChatGPT are incredibly useful for professional work, but moving their outputs into other tools is frustrating:  
- Formatting often gets lost when copy-pasting.  
- Screenshots are static and uneditable.  
- Whiteboarding and mindmapping tools rarely integrate smoothly with AI workflows.  

This gap makes it difficult to take AI-generated insights and **use them flexibly** for ideation, presentations, or structured planning.  

### Solution  
PinPoint was designed to experiment with bridging this gap:  
- **Web-native whiteboard**: A simple, fast environment for structuring ideas.  
- **Chrome extension**: Pin ChatGPT messages directly to the board, keeping formatting intact.  
- **Editable AI outputs**: Once pinned, text can be reorganized, annotated, or expanded further.  

This prototype allowed me to test new UX patterns for an **AI-native whiteboard experience**.  

### Findings & Reflections  
- **AI and whiteboards work well together**, but require new UX patterns—not just bolting AI onto existing tools.  
- Current ecosystems (Miro, Notion, etc.) often try to lock users in, but professionals already use multiple AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) depending on the task.  
- Pre-AI companies seem to be **forcing AI into their ecosystems** in ways that feel redundant or unnatural. The real opportunity is designing **AI-native tools** that complement how people already work.  

### Outcome  
PinPoint remains live and in production. The project reflects my curiosity in **future-of-work UX**, my ability to quickly prototype **full-stack web tools**, and my entrepreneurial drive to explore how **AI reshapes core workflows** like brainstorming and planning.
