## Smart Asset Management Platform – ERIKS Digital

When I took ownership of ERIKS’ IoT product, it was a standalone platform for vibration sensors monitoring motors, pumps, and other rotating equipment. While valuable, it sat in isolation—just one of many disconnected tools and manual workflows across the company.  

I saw an opportunity: unify these fragmented solutions into a single, modern domain for Asset Management. Through stakeholder alignment and product strategy, I became responsible for ERIKS’ entire global portfolio of asset management solutions.  

### What I did
- **Integrated siloed systems:** Brought equipment status monitoring into the main IoT platform, improving customer experience.  
- **Modernized asset tagging:** Introduced dynamic QR-code tagging, replacing manual barcodes and enabling scalable lifecycle tracking.  
- **Migrated legacy products:** Phased out two 20-year-old hose management systems, migrating 1,000+ customers to the secure unified platform.  
- **Developed new innovation:** Built a smart industrial pump monitoring feature to detect performance issues and failure modes in real time.  

### Outcome
The transformation repositioned ERIKS’ IoT platform from a niche sensor hub into a comprehensive asset management solution—enhancing customer experience, reducing maintenance costs, and unifying global workflows under one strategy.
