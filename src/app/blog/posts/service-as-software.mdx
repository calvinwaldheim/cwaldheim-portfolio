# Services as Software: Rethinking SaaS in the Age of AI

Over the past months, I‚Äôve been exploring new workflows and product concepts. One theme keeps coming back to me: **building product solutions has never been easier**‚Äîyet the way we think about productization and commercialization feels increasingly outdated.  

With the rise of AI-enabled coding and low-code platforms, the barrier to turning ideas into functional products is lower than ever. But this raises important questions for both builders and buyers.

## 1. Build vs. Buy: Who Still Needs Niche Software?

Not long ago, niche SaaS solutions filled critical gaps for companies that lacked the capacity to build in-house. But today, any reasonably skilled internal team‚Äîor even a contractor‚Äîcan stitch together tailored workflows with modern tools and AI assistance.  

That begs the question: **why should a company commit to perpetual subscription fees and vendor lock-in, when they could spin up their own solution in weeks, at lower cost, and perfectly aligned to their needs?**

## 2. Build vs. Buy, Revisited

Traditionally, the build-vs-buy decision hinged on cost, speed, and risk. Buying was faster but inflexible; building was slower but customizable.  

But with AI-enabled coding, that equation is shifting. Building isn‚Äôt slow anymore. The ‚Äúbuy‚Äù side of the argument needs to evolve to stay relevant.  

So what are companies really optimizing for? Security, maintainability, integration into legacy environments, and guaranteed support. SaaS still wins here‚Äîbut the margin is thinner than ever.

## 3. From SaaS to Services-as-Software

Here‚Äôs the thought experiment: maybe the problem isn‚Äôt SaaS itself, but the *form* it takes.  

Instead of selling software that customers need to operate, **what if companies sold the *outcome* as a productized service, powered by software?**  

Take customer support as an example:  

- **Old SaaS model**: You buy a support platform (ticketing, chat, dashboards).  
- **Services-as-Software model**: You buy *resolved tickets* and *satisfaction scores*. The vendor handles support end-to-end, blending AI + human agents behind the scenes.  

The distinction seems small, but it flips the value proposition. Companies pay not for tools, but for outcomes.

## 4. What This Means for Builders

For founders and product teams, this shift has two big implications:  

- **SaaS must compete with in-house builds.** Differentiation can‚Äôt just be ‚Äúfaster than building‚Äù anymore. It must be about trust, reliability, integration, or outcomes.  
- **Services-as-Software could unlock new models.** Rather than selling tools, think in terms of problems solved. Can your product deliver ‚ÄúX per month‚Äù instead of ‚Äúusers per seat‚Äù?

## 5. Where I Land (For Now)

I don‚Äôt think SaaS is going away anytime soon‚Äîbut I do think its *shape* will evolve. Companies will increasingly ask:  

- Can we build this ourselves faster?  
- If we buy, are we getting more than we could by coding it ourselves?  
- Are we buying tools, or are we buying outcomes?  

For me, the exciting opportunity lies in exploring **Services-as-Software**: productized services that deliver clear results, with software as the invisible enabler.

üí¨ **What do you think?** Do you agree that AI is eroding SaaS moats? Have you seen outcome-based service models in the wild? Or is SaaS still as strong as ever in your experience?
