## Tagline Options (pick one)
- Product manager who turns abstract ideas into shippable strategy for IoT and platform products—pragmatic, value‑driven, no theater.
- Vision‑to‑execution PM for complex B2B systems—platform consolidation, PMOps, and AI‑assisted workflows.
- Senior PM and systems thinker—teams, experiments, and measurable outcomes over buzzwords.

## Elevator Pitch (tweet‑length)
I turn ambiguous problems into clear strategies and shipped outcomes. I’ve led a 5→1 platform consolidation over three years, scaled monitoring 10–100× across 500 enterprise accounts, and rolled out Jira Align + Jira Product Discovery. I’m a team‑first builder and strong presenter who avoids innovation theater and focuses on work that matters.

## Short Bio (≈60 words)
I’m a product manager with 8+ years across IoT, platform strategy, and PMOps. I’m comfortable starting from zero, shaping abstract ideas into concrete roadmaps, and communicating decisions clearly. I value ambitious teams and meaningful problems. Based in Amsterdam; English & German C2.

## Long Bio (≈150–170 words)
I build products by starting with the fuzzy, shaping strategy, and driving execution. At ERIKS Digital I owned a 3‑year plan to consolidate five legacy apps into one IoT platform—migrating strategic customers and reducing platform costs to target. I increased asset monitoring 10–100× per customer via dynamic QR programs across the top 500 accounts and shipped reliability features like system‑status dashboards and pump failure analysis. Earlier I rolled out the Edison innovation framework in EMEA/APAC, contributed to a 1.5M+ SKU graph catalog, and led a supplier program that piloted vector‑embedding/ML on customer emails.

I’m versatile and independent: I took on the IoT portfolio without prior domain experience and raised its trajectory by learning fast and collaborating closely with engineering, data, and field teams. I communicate well in person and on stage, prefer ambitious teams that aim high, and avoid buzzwords or innovation theater. In 2019–2021 I also validated vertical‑farming systems over 2–3 years alongside work, and I still explore throwaway ideas to learn quickly.

## Projects & Case Study Blurbs

### Platform Consolidation (5→1 IoT product)
- Role: Product Manager (owner of strategy/roadmap)
- Problem: Fragmented UX/run‑costs; slow delivery; split customer base
- Actions: Single target platform; staged migrations for strategic accounts; guardrails; async decision docs
- Outcome: 5→1 consolidation; platform costs reduced to target; faster delivery cadence

### Asset Monitoring Scale‑Up (QR Program)
- Role: PM
- Problem: Limited asset coverage; manual inventory tracking
- Actions: Dynamic QR codes; rollout across top 500 customers; monitoring/analytics updates
- Outcome: 10–100× more monitored assets per customer; improved visibility and service workflows

### IoT Reliability Features (Status & Failure Analysis)
- Role: PM with engineering/data partners
- Problem: Limited observability and root‑cause insight
- Actions: System‑status tracking dashboards; advanced pump failure analysis
- Outcome: Higher reliability insights; tighter feedback loops for customers

### PMOps Rollout (Jira Align + JPD)
- Role: PM / PMOps coach
- Problem: Inconsistent discovery; weak portfolio visibility
- Actions: Jira Align for portfolio planning; JPD for discovery/ideation; coaching and evidence tracking
